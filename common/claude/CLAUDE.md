- **Language:** English only - all code, comments, docs, examples, commits, configs, errors, tests
- **Inclusive Terms:** allowlist/blocklist, primary/replica, placeholder/example, main branch, conflict-free, concurrent/parallel
- **Tools**: Use rg not grep, fd not find, tree is installed
- **Style**: Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- **Git**: Never commit or stage anything into git. You may use commands like git diff though
- **Notes**:
  * Unless I explicitly mention to implement something, do not update the code, if un-sure, ask me first. Always print a summary.
  * Always google first before asking me any questions. This should be crucial when implementing using any library or framework.
  * If you are unsure about any library or you do not have latest documentation, use context7 to get latest documentation. This has documentation for almost all popular libraries and frameworks.
  * Always prefer using latest versions of any library or framework unless I explicitly mention to use a specific version.
  * Always prefer using typescript over javascript unless I explicitly mention to use javascript
  * Always prefer using functional components and hooks over class components unless I explicitly mention to use class
  * If the feature is huge or if you are ever unsure, ask me first and clarify all doubts. Do not guess or assume anything.
