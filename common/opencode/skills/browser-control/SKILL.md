# Browser Control

Browser Control is a **driver**, not an agent. The calling agent decides what to
do; Browser Control runs deterministic Playwright code in the user's visible
browser.

Use one loop throughout: **inspect, act, verify**. Inspect the real page before
choosing locators, act through the narrowest stable control, then verify the
result through a URL or fresh page read. Never treat a successful click or human
acknowledgment as proof that the task succeeded.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Run The Task Directly

Start with the requested browser work. Relay-backed commands start the detached
relay and wait for the extension; do not start `browser-control serve` first.

```bash
browser-control execute 'return { url: page.url(), title: await page.title() }'
```

Use `browser-control doctor` only when setup or runtime behavior is unclear.
`status` and `doctor` are observational and never start the relay.

MCP startup, tool discovery, `skill`, and `session_current` do not contact the
relay. The first operational tool call starts it if needed; relay-backed
observational tools report unavailability instead of starting it.

Ordinary CLI/MCP/SDK calls never replace a running relay. On a build mismatch,
coordinate with other agents before running `browser-control relay restart`.
It preserves browser tabs and durable sessions but resets JavaScript state and
snapshot refs. A busy or timed-out drain leaves the old relay running; finish
recordings/captures and disconnect raw CDP clients rather than forcing a stop.

```bash
browser-control doctor
browser-control status --json
```

Completion: one execute returns a page result and a readable session id, or
`doctor` identifies the concrete setup failure.

### 2. Choose The Page Deliberately

The bundled shim 0.0.25 verifies debugger ownership during reconnection. Reload
the unpacked extension after installing this shim update. DevTools-attached tabs
are excluded from Browser Control's inventory. `page.title()` reads time out
after five seconds if the page execution context remains unavailable; the read
timeout does not close or replace the tab.

A bare CLI execute creates a fresh session-owned page and prints the exact
`--session <id>` continuation command. Every later CLI call must pass that id or
set `BROWSER_CONTROL_SESSION`; bare execute never guesses from human-shell
current state.

```bash
browser-control execute 'return page.url()'
browser-control execute --session cosmic-otter-866 'return page.url()'
```

MCP keeps one implicit process session. Omit `session` for that normal path, or
call `session_new` and pass an explicit id when one MCP process needs multiple
sessions.

To control a tab already open in the user's browser, ask the user to click the
Browser Control toolbar button on that tab. Select it for one execute or adopt
it for sticky reuse:

```bash
browser-control execute --target-url github.com 'return page.url()'
browser-control session adopt --target-url github.com --session github
```

`execute --target-url` selects a page for that call only. Continuing with just
`--session` uses the session's default page, which may still be `about:blank`.
For a multi-step task in an existing user tab, adopt it first. Always include
`page.url()` when diagnosing an empty snapshot. Snapshot labels are compact
descriptions; use `ref()` for actions rather than assuming their text is an
exact Playwright accessible name.

`targetUrl` and `targetIndex` select existing attached pages; they never
navigate. A URL selector must match exactly one page, and URL and index selectors
cannot be combined. Adoption makes that tab the session default, closes the
session's previous relay-created page, and is exclusive to one Browser Control
session. Reset or delete releases an adopted user tab without closing it.

Prefer adoption for authenticated browser state rather than reproducing login
in a fresh page.

Each relay controls one browser/profile at a time. A second extension connection
cannot replace a healthy active connection. If `status` or `doctor` reports
rejected competing connections, keep the extension enabled only in the intended
browser/profile. To switch browsers, disconnect the incumbent extension first;
creating a new execute session does not switch browsers.

Completion: the selected page URL is the intended page, and later work either
retains the returned session id or intentionally uses the MCP process session.

### 3. Inspect, Act, Verify

Inspect before guessing roles or selectors:

```js
return await snapshot()
```

Then act from the returned structure and verify the destination:

```js
await ref("e12").click()
await page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Settings" }).waitFor()
if (!page.url().includes("/settings")) {
  throw new Error(`Unexpected destination: ${page.url()}`)
}
return { url: page.url(), heading: await page.getByRole("heading").first().innerText() }
```

Use normal Playwright first. Keep dependent interactions in one execute when
they rely on transient UI such as an open menu, selected rows, hover state, or
an in-progress form.

If native `locator.fill()` hangs because a browser extension interferes with
focus, use the explicit input, textarea, or contenteditable fallback:

```js
await fillInput(page.getByPlaceholder("Username"), "standard_user")
```

Completion: the final return value contains evidence of the requested outcome,
not merely evidence that an action was attempted.

### 4. Continue Or Finish Cleanly

Named sessions preserve their default page across short-lived CLI and MCP
processes. They also survive relay restarts: Browser Control restores the id,
read-only mode, and exact default target. JavaScript `state` and snapshot refs
are process-local and reset after a relay restart with an explicit warning.

```bash
browser-control session list
browser-control session reset github
browser-control session delete github
```

Deletion is idempotent for an explicit session id, so cleanup can be safely
retried when that session is already absent.

Every execute is journaled under
`~/.browser-control/sessions/<id>/journal.jsonl`. The journal records code,
status, duration, URL movement, warnings, handoffs, and bounded diagnostics.
Never place credentials directly in execute source.

```bash
browser-control journal --session github --limit 50
```

Completion: retain the session only when follow-up work is expected; otherwise
reset or delete session-owned pages and report any warnings that affect later
work.

## Canonical Authenticated Flow

The distinguishing Browser Control workflow is an authenticated tab plus a
human-only prompt:

Attach and adopt the existing tab, inspect its real UI, fill ordinary fields,
then register `handoff` before triggering WebAuthn, 2FA, CAPTCHA, or payment UI.
After the user completes it, verify the authenticated destination. The same
session can continue after an MCP process or relay restart.

When the prompt-triggering action may itself block, put only that action in
`start`. Browser Control presents and acknowledges WAIT before invoking it:

```js
await handoff("Complete the security-key prompt, then continue", {
  timeoutMs: 600_000,
  start: () => page
    .getByRole("button", { name: /passkey|security key|sign in/i })
    .click({ timeout: 600_000 }),
})

await page.waitForURL((url) => !url.pathname.startsWith("/login"))
await page.getByRole("heading", { name: /account|dashboard/i }).waitFor()
return { authenticatedUrl: page.url(), title: await page.title() }
```

After a resolved handoff, Browser Control waits through transient destination
context replacement before returning, so this verification can remain in the
same execute.

For a handoff on another page, pass `{ page: otherPage }`. Readiness checks that
page, not the session default. If a non-default page was replaced or closed,
inspect the remaining pages rather than assuming an old Playwright reference
now identifies its replacement.

Tell the user what action is waiting. Human acknowledgment is not verification:
always assert the expected URL or stable element after `handoff`. If the action
was already completed and only the human step remains, call `handoff(message)`
without `start`. The default timeout is ten minutes.

Completion: the prompt was presented only after WAIT was registered, the action
settled, and the authenticated result was independently verified.

To turn a user-demonstrated flow into reusable Playwright, use `demonstrate()`.
It uses the same exact-tab handoff, records clicks, edits, checkbox/select
changes, and same-tab navigations, then returns editable code:

```ts
return await demonstrate("Perform the workflow once, then continue")
```

Password fields become explicit secret-source comments rather than copied
values. Review selectors and add outcome assertions before reusing generated
code; a demonstration records actions, not proof that the workflow succeeded.

### Password Manager Prompts

Ordinary webpage fields and accessible open-shadow-root controls remain usable.
1Password's inline menus are extension-owned iframes, not ordinary webpage DOM.
Chromium blocks one extension from debugging another extension's pages; toolbar
popups and native unlock, Touch ID, and Windows Hello prompts are not supported
Playwright control surfaces.

Focusing or filling a card-number or credential field can open the inline menu
by itself, even inside a third-party payment iframe. While it is open, Chrome
rejects every automation command for that tab; Playwright shows this as
"Execution context was destroyed" or a locator timeout, so the execute result
carries the `target/cross-extension-page` diagnostic and warning, and
`browser-control status` marks the tab `protected-ui=true`.

`target/cross-extension-page` means a permission boundary. Ask the user to finish
or dismiss the prompt and retry; do not reset the page, read vault contents, or
weaken browser security to get around it. The page itself is healthy: do not
treat the failure as an unresponsive tab or create a new page. Register `handoff` on the originating
webpage before triggering a human-only prompt when possible. If the prompt
already prevents attachment, give the user the required action directly rather
than assuming an in-page handoff can be displayed. Verify the intended webpage
state after the prompt is completed.

## Inspection Tools

Use the least expensive view that answers the question:

- `snapshot()` is the compact read-before-act default. It prioritizes semantic
  groups, alerts, lists, tables, headings, links, and controls. Text input and
  textarea values are omitted.
- The default snapshot scopes to a single visible modal when present; portal
  dialogs outside `main` remain discoverable. Use an explicit `within` scope
  when you intentionally need background content. Repeated list wrappers have
  a bounded reservation so product links can still fit in a dense page.
- Native number/search inputs are `spinbutton`/`searchbox`. Native disclosure
  controls are labeled `summary`, which is an element kind rather than an ARIA
  role; use the returned `ref()` to operate them.
- `ref("e12")` resolves a control from the latest snapshot. Refs fail closed
  after navigation or incompatible DOM drift. Compatible refs keep the same id
  across repeated same-document captures.
- `snapshot({ diff: true })` reports semantic changes from the compatible prior
  baseline. `snapshot({ delta: true })` returns a full first baseline and compact
  deltas afterward. Existing compatible refs remain usable.
- `snapshot({ find: "checkout", context: 2 })` searches the bounded semantic
  snapshot and returns matching lines with nearby context and actionable refs.
- `ariaSnapshot(target?, { timeout })` returns Playwright's detailed YAML aria
  tree when the compact snapshot omits needed structure. Native text-control
  values, custom ARIA range values, and editable content are omitted so they do
  not enter tool output. Await it separately; do not run other operations on
  the same page concurrently.
- `screenshotWithLabels({ page, path? })` adds visual labels and metadata when
  layout matters.
- `screenshotDiff({ baseline, path?, threshold?, fullPage? })` compares a saved
  PNG (absolute path or Buffer) with the current session page at CSS-pixel scale.
  It returns `matches`, `changedPixels`, `changedRatio` (0..1), dimensions, and a
  red-highlighted PNG. Omit `path` to return the image as execute media; otherwise
  supply a fresh absolute `.png` path. Existing output files are never overwritten.

```js
return await snapshot({ within: "main", maxItems: 200 })
return await snapshot({ find: /checkout|payment/i, context: 2 })
return await snapshot({ delta: true })
// When layout matters, return the image through MCP so it can be inspected.
return await screenshotWithLabels({ page })
```

Saving an image and returning only `"ok"` proves file creation, not visual
correctness. Return screenshot buffers through MCP when visual evidence matters.

For visual regression checks, save a baseline before changing the UI:

```ts
await page.screenshot({ path: "/absolute/before.png", scale: "css" })
// After the intended UI change, in the same viewport:
return await screenshotDiff({ baseline: "/absolute/before.png" })
```

The threshold defaults to 0.1 and controls per-pixel color tolerance, not the
allowed changed area. Set it to 0 for exact pixels. Antialiasing changes count.
Settle animations yourself and use the same viewport and `fullPage` setting for
both captures. Dimension mismatches fail explicitly; images are never resized.
Comparisons are limited to PNGs of 32 MiB / 16 megapixels each. Screenshots and
diffs include visible page content: inspect for private information before sharing.

## Execute Interface

Execute code can use `page`, `context`, `browser`, persistent `state`, selected
Node modules through `modules` and aliases such as `fs` and `path`, plus the
Browser Control helpers documented here. Single expressions auto-return;
multi-statement scripts need `return`. Use `--file` for longer scripts:

```bash
browser-control execute --session github --file ./perform-flow.js
```

Human CLI output includes logs, warnings, and a concise aftermath. Use `--json`
when another command needs to branch on `ok`, `value`, `error`, `warnings`, or
`aftermath`:

```bash
browser-control execute --json --session github '({ url: page.url() })' | jq .value.url
```

Playwright downloads are unavailable through extension-backed tabs because
Chromium blocks download artifact control through `chrome.debugger`. If the
page exposes the payload through fetch or an API response, read the bytes in the
page and write them with `fs`. Do not retry `page.waitForEvent("download")`.

Pages with WebMCP enabled can expose structured page tools. Discover and call
them through the execute helper; names, descriptions, schemas, and results come
from the page:

```ts
const tools = await webmcp.list()
const result = await webmcp.call("search_catalog", { query: "adapter" })
return { tools, result }
```

Discovery covers all frames. If the same name appears in multiple frames, pass
the exact reported frame label as `{ frame }`. Browser Control re-discovers the
tool immediately before invoking it, so stale registrations fail directly.

## Safety

Browser Control blocks CDP commands that would destroy shared browser state,
including browser close and cookie/cache clearing. Never work around those
guardrails.

For inspect-only work, use a read-only session:

```bash
browser-control session new inspect-prod --read-only
browser-control execute --session inspect-prod 'await page.goto("https://example.com"); return page.title()'
```

Read-only sessions reject `Input.*`, so they cannot click or type through
Playwright. `page.evaluate` can still mutate the DOM; read-only prevents trusted
mistakes, not malicious code.

For destructive UI work, use a two-phase **read, confirm, verify** flow:

1. Read candidates and return exact stable identifiers or row text.
2. Obtain user approval for those exact items.
3. Re-select only approved items and assert the selected count.
4. Read the confirmation dialog and throw unless it matches the approved action.
5. Confirm, then verify through a fresh page read or independent CLI/API path.

Do not discover and confirm destructive candidates in one script unless the
user already approved exact stable identifiers. Never globally auto-accept
native dialogs; wait for the expected dialog and assert its type and message
before accepting it.

## TypeScript Client

Applications can import `BrowserControlClient` for schema-decoded,
same-origin requests authenticated by a session page. Use `sensitive: true`
for token-bearing responses and reveal them through Browser Control's API, not
the application's own Effect `Redacted` import; package-manager layouts may
resolve separate Effect runtimes.

```ts
import { BrowserControlClient } from "@opencode-ai/browser-control"

const sensitive = yield* origin.json({
  path: "/api/session",
  method: "POST",
  body: {},
  response: SessionResponse,
  sensitive: true,
})
const session = BrowserControlClient.reveal(sensitive)
```

## Authenticated Network Capture

Use network capture when the browser is needed to authenticate or discover a
workflow, but repeated direct HTTP calls would be faster and more reliable.
Capture each flow at least twice with different inputs so constants and
parameters can be distinguished.

```bash
browser-control network start --session github --url /api/ \
  --resource-type fetch --resource-type xhr
browser-control execute --session github --file ./perform-flow.js
browser-control network status --session github
browser-control network stop --session github \
  --output ./github.har --secrets github
```

Written artifacts replace credential-bearing headers, cookies, query fields,
and structured body fields with stable references such as `${BC_SECRET_1}`.
`--secrets github` stores lossless values separately in a mode-`0600` Secret
Profile. Never copy profile values into source, output, diagnostics, or journals,
and never deliberately return or log credentials.

Inspect the redacted artifact offline, generate one typed function per observed
flow, then verify each function with a harmless live request. Run generated
clients without exposing values:

```bash
browser-control secrets status github
browser-control secrets run github -- ./github-cli repositories
```

Generated TypeScript applications can own that wrapper internally through the
public SDK:

```ts
import { SecretProfile } from "@opencode-ai/browser-control"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const result = await Effect.runPromise(SecretProfile.run({
  name: "github",
  command: process.execPath,
  args: ["./github-cli.js", "repositories"],
}))
```

The trusted worker receives `BC_SECRET_N` variables and its bounded output is
redacted. The public SDK exposes profile metadata but never raw profile values.

Refresh credentials normally renewed by a page reload with:

```bash
browser-control secrets refresh github --session github --url /api/
```

If refresh requires login or a human prompt, reauthenticate in the adopted tab
and repeat capture with the same profile. MCP exposes equivalent `network_*`
and `secrets_*` tools.

Completion: the artifact contains references rather than credential values, the
generated operation passes a harmless live check, and no secret value appears
in source or output.

## Recording

Record an attached or session-owned tab with:

```bash
browser-control recording start ./tmp/demo.mp4 --session github --mode cdp
browser-control recording status --session github
browser-control recording stop --session github
```

Start, stop, and status accept `--json`. CDP stop/status results include a
`quality` receipt: output dimensions/rate, source and retained-image counts/rates,
coalesced/dropped frames, and `screenshotFallback`. The fallback means no
compositor frames arrived and the video holds one stop-time screenshot; do not
present that as recorded motion. Source counters count compositor events, not
visually distinct frames. Low rates can be normal on a static page. Tab capture
and older relays omit quality telemetry rather than inventing measurements.

Explicit frame rates must be integers from 1 through 60 in either mode; invalid
values fail instead of silently clamping. The start result reports the chosen rate.

`--mode auto` uses tab capture for user-owned tabs and CDP for relay-owned tabs.
Tab capture can include audio; CDP requires `ffmpeg` and has no audio. Use the
command's `--help` for format and cursor options.

CDP recordings preserve the starting CSS viewport (not a fixed 720p canvas),
use high-quality source frames, and default to 60 fps. Use `--frame-rate 30`
for smaller files. Actual motion still depends on Chrome delivering new frames;
60 fps output does not guarantee 60 distinct frames. Larger viewports cost more
CPU, transport bandwidth, and storage. Set the viewport before recording and do
not change viewport/emulation mid-recording. Odd dimensions round down to even.

For failures that are hard to reproduce, keep a rolling CDP frame buffer and
save recent history after the problem occurs:

```bash
browser-control flight-recorder start --session github --retention-ms 60000
browser-control flight-recorder status --session github
browser-control flight-recorder save-last ./tmp/failure.mp4 --session github --duration-ms 30000
browser-control flight-recorder cancel --session github
```

Saving does not stop buffering. The recorder is memory-bounded, reports retained
duration/frame/byte/drop counters, writes a JSON receipt beside each clip, and is
mutually exclusive with ordinary recording on the same tab. CLI recording and
flight-recorder lifecycle operations are also available as MCP tools.

Inspect an encoded frame at native size before sharing: the whole viewport must
fill the frame, small text must be readable, and motion must not be a repeated
still image. Do not crop and upscale a low-resolution capture to call it HD.
On an older installed relay that shrinks the page into a padded corner, record
the defect and coordinate a recorder update; changing the file's resolution is
not a repair.

Completion: stop the recorder, inspect the resulting media rather than only its
existence, and report the viewport, state, and interaction path actually tested.

## Troubleshooting

1. Run `browser-control doctor`; it checks package metadata, CLI/relay build
   identity, extension protocol compatibility, sessions, targets, and artifacts.
2. Use `status --json` to inspect exact sessions and target ownership.
3. Reproduce once with the smallest execute before changing code.

Common diagnoses:

- `connected:false`: run a relay-backed command and allow the extension startup
  or alarm wake-up to reconnect. Reload the unpacked extension only if that loop
  does not recover.
- Incompatible extension protocol: update either the extension or npm package;
  exact extension and relay release versions do not need to match.
- Competing browser/profile connections: the active browser is preserved and
  additional connections are rejected. Use one browser/profile per relay;
  repeatedly creating sessions or resetting tabs does not switch browsers.
- Stale relay build: inspect `doctor`, then coordinate an explicit
  `browser-control relay restart`. It requires an exact managed instance and
  safe shutdown protocol 2. Legacy relays need a one-time coordinated manual
  stop; foreground/source or newer relays are never force-killed or downgraded.
  MCP observational tools remain available on a mismatch.
- Unexpected restart: inspect private endpoint-scoped
  `~/.browser-control/relays/<port>/lifecycle.jsonl` for requester/build/instance
  metadata. Preparing or selecting a development candidate must not restart the
  daemon. Use isolated `runtime:prepare` / `runtime:select`, not a live checkout
  link, when developing Browser Control itself.
- `Target not found`: attach the intended tab, then select or adopt it using a
  unique URL substring or explicit index.
- All targets disappeared: dismissing Chromium's debugging banner detaches every
  tab. Reattach through the toolbar.
- Relay restarted: named sessions reclaim exact targets, but JavaScript `state`
  and snapshot refs reset. Continue after the warning.
- Reset/delete after an extension update may wait briefly for target
  re-announcement; if the old relay-owned target is absent from the completed
  inventory, Browser Control forgets the dead identity without closing a
  guessed tab.
- Repeated execution-context errors: run one short follow-up so Browser Control
  can health-check the page. A live page is kept: Browser Control reconnects and
  re-resolves the same tab once, then fails with a `session-page/*-unresponsive`
  diagnosis if the page still does not answer. Only a crashed, `about:blank`, or
  `chrome-error://` relay-owned page is closed and recreated. It never replaces
  an adopted user tab. When a page stays unresponsive (bot-protected sites can
  stall the main world for automation while rendering normally for the human),
  open a fresh tab with `context.newPage()` or hand the tab to the user.
- Handoff ends with "page execution context did not become available": the user
  finished; only Browser Control's view of the tab is stale. Run a short
  follow-up execute so the page is re-checked instead of assuming it was lost.
- Fill timeout on login fields: inspect first, then try `fillInput` after
  confirming the selector or locator resolves. String selectors search open
  shadow roots recursively; closed shadow roots remain unavailable.
- Click blocked by a verified dialog backdrop: inspect the exact target and
  blocker first. If the target is the approved action and Playwright actionability
  alone is stale, dispatch `await locator.evaluate((element) => element.click())`,
  then verify the result. Do not make dispatched clicks the default.
- Hidden checkbox/radio input: click its visible associated label or wrapper,
  then verify `isChecked()`. Do not force-click an invisible input or infer an
  arbitrary ancestor.
- Download wait fails: use fetch plus `fs`; extension-backed Playwright cannot
  retain a native download artifact.
- Hover on an infinitely animated target: Playwright may never consider the
  element stable. Read its current `getBoundingClientRect()` and use
  `page.mouse.move()` when coordinate input is appropriate.
- Chromium-protected pages such as the Chrome Web Store developer dashboard may
  detach `chrome.debugger`. Do not retry or bypass that boundary; open the page
  for manual operation.

For deeper relay diagnosis, restart with `BROWSER_CONTROL_DEBUG=1`. Debug traces
must never include expressions, arguments, results, headers, cookies, or form
values.

Whenever Browser Control fails, wedges, replaces a page/session, or behaves
unexpectedly, create or update a `browser-control` project todo with the Browser
Control version, safe session/page context, exact error, deterministic
reproduction, expected versus actual behavior, and recovery attempted. Never
include credentials, form values, or private account data.
