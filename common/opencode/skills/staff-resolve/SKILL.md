# Staff Resolve

Work through unresolved Staff Review threads on a diff. For each thread, choose
exactly one outcome: fix the code, document the lesson, or skip with a clear
justification.

## Load

- For any resolve run, read `references/resolve-workflow.md`.
- For documentation entry format, read `.agents/skills/staff-document/SKILL.md`
  only when documenting a thread.
- For comment commands, read `.agents/skills/staff-comment/SKILL.md` only when
  posting replies or resolutions.
- If the user only asks what this skill does, do not load references.

## Rules

- Resolve supplied findings without requiring the CLI.
- Read all open threads before editing so related fixes can be grouped.
- For persisted threads, reply with the explanation, then resolve the thread.
- Honor `documentRequested: true` by writing a docs entry and resolving as
  documented.
- Run relevant checks for touched code.
- Do not delete review comments or commit.
